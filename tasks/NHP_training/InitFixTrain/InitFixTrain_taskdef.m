% Initial fixation training task
%
%   This task should be used to train an animal to keep its gaze continously on a target item
%   and basically  prepare for eye calibration. Fixation targets could be shown at random location
%   or location is manually controlled. And depending on the settings, the animal could receive an
%   ititial reward when starting to fixate, then receive a series of reward pulses until a specified
%   fixation time when a large reward will be given.
