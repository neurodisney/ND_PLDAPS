This is an experimental proof of concept to get the NVIDIA 3d stereo
controller working with OpenGL on linux. If this program or any part
of it causes any damage to your hardware, software or health, it is your
own fault. You have been warned.

I do not claim any copyright or ownership on the firmware or drivers of
any device by NVIDIA.


Prerequisites
=============

If you dare to try this out, you will need the following things first:

- The NVIDIA 3d stereo controller and compatible shutter glasses
- Hardware accelerated graphics
- A monitor capable of 120 Hz (I didn't try out any other refresh rate)

- The firmware extracted from the windows driver (see below)

- libusb
- GLUT
- gcc and make
- XF86vmode


Building and running
====================

To build everything just type
  ./configure
  make

To try it out type

  ./example/example

If everything works you should now see a white 3-dimensional triangle. In
the upper left corner is an additional triangle that is meant to be seen
only by the left eye. In the upper right corner another triangle should
only be seen by the right eye.

You can change the view a little by using the wheel on the back of the 
controller.


It doesn't work
===============

I don't give any support for this program. However here are some ideas
what could be problems and how to solve them.

- Make sure the LED on the front of the controller is glowing bright
  green. 
  
  If it is not glowing at all, check the cable connections. 
  
  If it stopped glowing on program startup, an error probably occured during 
  uploading of the firmware. Disconnect and reconnect to reset the device.

  If it is glowing red, no firmware was uploaded, probably the device was
  not found.

- Make sure your monitor is actually running at 120 Hz.

  Consult the documentation of your X on how to configure it.

- Disable any compositors, or disable the Composite extension completely.


Where do I get the firmware?
============================

It must be extracted from the Windows driver. Its file name is nvstusb.sys
and you can find it under c:\windows\system32\drivers if you have a windows
installation. Or you can try finding it on the internet. Currently I only 
tried it with version 6.14.11.9062 of the file. Others might work as well
but I give no promises. 

To extract the firmware simply run

  ./tools/extractfw path-to-nvstusb.sys

and hope everything works just fine. ;)
